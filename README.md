# WSU Alerts Child Theme

## Header

A common header is shown on all alert.wsu.edu pages and is populated with information on the latest active alert. This common header is split into two pieces.

### Overall alert status

The text at the top of the page changes depending on the status:

* Emergency: "There is an active emergency"
* Warning: "There is an active warning"
* None: "There are no alerts"

### Full Announcement

* If there are no active alerts, the area is colored green and the text shows "There are no warnings or emergencies".
* If there is an active **warning**, the area is colored yellow and the text of the warning is displayed.
* If there is an active **emergency**, the area is colored orange and the text of the warning is displayed.

## Front page

The front page (after the common header) displays the most recent 3 announcements in the first section. These can be categorized in any way.

The remaining sections on the page are customizable through the page builder interface.
